Writing a useful content extractor:
* Should take a site map URI
* Traverses the site map, creating folders and placing the useful content into each as a html file
* Should take a map of content to include and ignore
** Included content is content boilerpipe doesn't find useful but we force it to be included
** Ignored content is content boilerpipe finds useful but we force it to be ignored
** Order of the content should be kept
